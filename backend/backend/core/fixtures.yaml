    title: Squat,
    note: 'Squats are king because they''''re simply the most
      challenging leg movement you can do, especially when loaded appropriately. They
      work all the lower-body musculature (we''''re counting glutes) and have been
      shown to spike muscle-building hormone release. In fact, we even know that squatting
      before doing curls has been shown to significantly improve arm strength!',

    title: Olympic Lifts,
    note: 'Movements like snatches and power cleans take
      some serious dedication and technique to master, but they can be unrivaled when
      you are trying to improve jumping power or squat strength. In fact, one scientific
      study found a nearly 18-percent greater improvement in squat 1RM after following
      an Olympic-based program compared to a traditional powerlifting program.',

    note: 'This is a nice way to address any
      strength imbalances between one side and the other. It also adds an intense
      core-stability (rotary stability) component as well, as you have to fire all
      you have to not fall off the bench',

    note: "This variation is the counterpoint
      to Dan John's batwing row exercise. You hold one dumbbell a few inches above
      your chest as you perform all your repetitions on the other side.\r\n\r\nSwitch,
      and repeat on the opposite side. Ouch.",
